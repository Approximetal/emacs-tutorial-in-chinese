# emacs-tutorial-in-chinese

This is a series of emacs tutorials written in chinese. 

Although if I have written in english the series might gain more popularity,
the fact which encourages me to contribute these articles is that the existing chinese guide is far from enough to help starters unlock the power of emacs as quickly as possible.

Any suggestion from those who understand chinese is welcome.
